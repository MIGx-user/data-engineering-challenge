# MIGx Data Engineer Technical Challenge
Congratulations, you’ve made it to the technical test! Completing this will help us assess your technical and problem-solving skills.

## Description
This exercise consists of two distinct parts. The first one is a programming problem, where you are expected to set up a small project from scratch in order to solve the use case problem explained below, using either Scala or Python as your programming language of choice. How you set up the project and its structure is up to you, and you can use any data processing library you see fit (or no dependencies at all!). In any case, you’ll have to provide instructions on how to run this project
locally.
The second part are open-ended questions on different aspects of architecture and high-level decisions you may have to take on hypothetical scenarios. You can write down the answers to them in any popular file format (like Word, Markdown, Asciidoc, etc.) and optionally export it to a PDF. Just make sure you give us the raw file.
Keep in mind that you’re not expected to complete the totality of this assignment. If you don’t complete some bullet points that’s OK, it will help us guide the follow-up interview where we’ll ask you about what you’ve given to us and why you did (or didn’t) take those decisions.
